# House Price Prediction:

### Project Overview:
This project involves analyzing the "Ames Housing dataset", which provides us a detailed information on the residential properties in Ames, Iowa. The dataset is widely used for predictive modeling and includes 82 columns describing various attributes of the properties.

### Modeling Approach and Results:
The project focused on building a predictive model for house sale prices using Gradient Boosting, optimized with GridSearchCV. The model's performance metrics are as follows:
- **Test Dataset**:
  - R² Score: 0.911
  - RMSE: 25,314.97
  - MAE: 14,136.20
- **Validation Dataset**:
  - R² Score: 0.940
  - RMSE: 20,214.73
  - MAE: 13,529.91
These results indicate that the model effectively predicts house prices with high accuracy.

### Conclusion:
The Gradient Boosting model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities, with potential for further enhancement through advanced techniques and additional data processing. This project lays the groundwork for accurate and reliable house price predictions in Ames, Iowa.
